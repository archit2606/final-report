# Final-report

In this report we prepared a predictive model for typing the next words. This was done by studying the dataset created for bigrams, trigrams and quadgrams in the previous milestone report. The three datasets were saved and then loaded for building the predictive model.

The ui.R aand server.R files are uploaded in this repository on the github. You can also see how my application works which was hosted on shinyapps.io by clicking on the following link: [https://archit2606.shinyapps.io/Final_report/?_ga=2.42611173.1195735020.1590500057-1014391710.1590361778]
